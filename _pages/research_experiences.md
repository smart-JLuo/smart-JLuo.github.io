I have written and been quoted in a number of pieces related to AI ethics and applications of NLP systems.

*   Co-wrote op-ed with Dr. Emily Bender [AI surveillance in prisons is a terrible idea, both technologically and ethically](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/guest-post-ai-surveillance-prisons-terrible-idea-technologically-ethically/) in Geekwire
*   Quoted in [Google Hopes AI Can Turn Search Into a Conversation](https://www.wired.com/story/google-hopes-ai-turn-search-conversation/) by Khari Johnson for Wired
*   Quoted in [SOB confusion: How voice recognition is getting shaken up for health care](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2021/04/28/sob-confusion-how-voice-recognition-is-getting-shaken-up-for-health-care-794924) by Mohana Ravindranath for Politico 

My research has been discussed in many publications, including [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21737017-you-can-train-your-gadgets-understand-what-youre-saying-world) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/good-girls-revolt/510245/). If you're a reporter, I'm always happy to chat about my research, natural language procesing of data science in general. You can find my contact information in the left sidebar.
