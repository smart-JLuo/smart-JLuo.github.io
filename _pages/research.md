Current Research Interests
======
* Neural PDE Solvers [Resource Home Page](https://zbz3th212a4.larksuite.com/docx/M0Kpdfmg8oOryjxt0nZuOI7ds2g?from=from_copylink)
	* Neural Operators (Learning in infinite-dimensional function spaces, as opposed to traditional neural networks that learn vector-to-vector mappings)
	* Physics Informed Neural Networks (Solving PDEs by penalizing the extent to which the network solution violates the PDE)
* Equivariance (Embedding symmetries into networks) [Resource Home Page](https://zbz3th212a4.larksuite.com/docx/Q7oYdCrfUoBZNRxEIXquvENDsuc?from=from_copylink)
	* Group CNN (Lifts features to the group space and performs convolutions in the group space; used more in vision tasks).
	* Geometric GNNs (Restrict features and/or operations to maintain equivariance; used more for geometric data (e.g., point clouds with spatial coordinates)
	* Unconstrained Methods (Offset the symmetries to the data instead of the model; particular useful for large pretrained models, e.g. LLMs)
* Generative Models (Learning the underlying data distribution and generate new, realistic samples that resemble the original data) [Resource Home Page](https://zbz3th212a4.larksuite.com/docx/JxHVdu8mvop8LIxkvdDuGaywsZd?from=from_copylink)
	* Mathematical and statistical aspects of generative models (e.g. accelerating generative models)
	* Generative models for science (e.g. drug designs)
