* Neural PDE Solvers [Resource Home Page](https://zbz3th212a4.larksuite.com/docx/M0Kpdfmg8oOryjxt0nZuOI7ds2g?from=from_copylink)
	* Neural Operators (Learning in infinite-dimensional function spaces, as opposed to traditional neural networks that learn vector-to-vector mappings)
		* [Short Intro: Neural Operators](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Neural_Operator_files/Neural_Operators.pdf)
	* Physics Informed Neural Networks (Solving PDEs by penalizing the extent to which the network solution violates the PDE)
		* [Sec. 1.2.2 of My Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999122009111); [Exemplary Notebook for Simple 2D Poisson](https://github.com/wenhangao21/wenhangao21.github.io/tree/master/files/PINN_files/PINN_Example_Simple_2D_Poission.ipynb)
* Equivariance (Embedding symmetries into networks) [Resource Home Page](https://zbz3th212a4.larksuite.com/docx/Q7oYdCrfUoBZNRxEIXquvENDsuc?from=from_copylink)
	* [Short Intros and Toy Code](https://wenhangao21.github.io/equivariance/)
* Generative Models (Learning the underlying data distribution and generate new, realistic samples that resemble the original data) [Resource Home Page](https://zbz3th212a4.larksuite.com/docx/JxHVdu8mvop8LIxkvdDuGaywsZd?from=from_copylink)
	* [Short Intro: Generative Models and VAE](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Generation_files/VAE_10192024.pdf); [Notebook for Simple VAE on MNIST Data](https://github.com/wenhangao21/wenhangao21.github.io/tree/master/files/Generation_files/VAE_implementation.ipynb)
	

The materials will be regularly updated, with more content added over time. If you find them helpful and would like to use any of my slides or code, feel free to use them.
