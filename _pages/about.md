# About me
I'm a third-year master student in Electronic Engineering and Information Science at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). 📕

Previous, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering from [Central China Normal University](https://english.ccnu.edu.cn/) in [Electronic Information Engineering](https://physics.ccnu.edu.cn/English.htm).

I'm interested in Natural Language Processing, LLMs, Knowledge Graph, Operator Learning, and AI for Science. Also I have published several papers about AI4PDE and AI for Scientific Computing. 

Currently, I'm working with [Wenhan Gao](https://wenhangao21.github.io/) for designing enhanced kernels for localized effects and interactions in FNO.

If you are interested about my research topics, feel free to contact me through my email: jianluo(at)mail(dot)ustc(dot)edu(dot)com . 📫
