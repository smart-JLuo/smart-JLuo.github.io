A Little More About Me
======
I am a first-generation immigrant. My family and I moved to the United States, like many others, in pursuit of a better life—the American dream. When I first got here, I barely spoke English and worked in restaurant kitchens and as a food delivery driver. After a year, I realized this wasn't the future I wanted. I decided to continue my education. I began at a community college, an immersion program to learn English. Eventually, I transferred to Stony Brook. Unlike many who took many AP courses in high school, I didn’t learn Calculus 2 until my sophomore year. Today, I’m a Ph.D. student in applied mathematics and the first author of several papers in top-tier journals and conferences. I’m deeply grateful to those who supported me along the way. While my journey to success continues, I hope my story inspires others facing similar struggles. It's never too late to begin.
