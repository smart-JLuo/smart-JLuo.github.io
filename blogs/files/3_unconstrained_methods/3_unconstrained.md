# Unconstrained Methods for Symmetries

**TL;DR:** This blog introduces unconstrained methods for symmetries, taking the $E(3)$ group and point cloud data as an example.

This tutorial aims to **simplify abstract concepts for newcomers**. Coding examples are provided to illustrate PCA on point clouds, frame averaging, and equivariance.

- The toy implementation, along with some slides, can be found [here](https://github.com/wenhangao21/Tutorials/tree/main/Equivariance).
- It is assumed that you are familiar with the [Group CNN](https://wenhangao21.github.io/blogs/files/1_gconv/1_gconv/) and [Geometric GNNs](https://wenhangao21.github.io/blogs/files/2_geometric_GNNs/2_geometric_GNNs/). If not, please read them first.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Motivation

(Constrained) Geometric GNNs enforce symmetries directly into the architecture.
- Restricting its set of possible operations or representations.
- Hindering network capacity to fully express the intricacies of the data.
- Computational inefficient.
- For large pretrained models, such as GPT, we cannot alter their network designs to ensure equivariance!

  <span style="color: red;"><em>Does enforcing equivariance/symmetries as an inductive bias truly offset a potential reduction in optimization diversity within the constrained learning spaces?</em></span>

An alternative approach that does not have any of the aforementioned shortcomings is frame/group averaging.
