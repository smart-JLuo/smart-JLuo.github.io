# Physics Informed Neural Networks in 5 Minutes

**TL;DR:** This blog introduces the high level ideas of physics informed neural networks [1] in 5 minutes. A simple implementation to solve a Poission's equation with both PINN and finite difference is also provided. 


- The toy implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/wenhangao21/Tutorials/tree/main/Neural_PDE_Solvers).

## 1. Introduction
